# Sorting and Recursion
This program reads a text file of integers each on a separate line (where the first line/number represents the total integers contained in the file to be sorted) then proceeds to compare the average runtime (over 50 trials) of 6 different sorts:

Insertion Sort
Recursive Merge Sort
Iterative Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Hybrid Quick Sort
Mutually Recursive Merge & Quick Sort
